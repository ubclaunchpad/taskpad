# taskpad
A collaborative intro to pull requests and code review for iOS, with 8 non-conflicting TODOs.

How to use:
- This is a basic todo style app. It almost works.
- Assign each team member (up to 8) one TODO. Each TODO should be approx one line of code change.
- Each team member should follow good branching and code style guidelines.
- Submit a Pull Request / Merge Request once finished with said TODO.
- There should be no merge conflicts based on how each TODO is set up.

Enjoy!
